<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "ApvDataFifo_2048x12.v" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of dcfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "ApvDataFifo_2048x12.v".  The design "ApvDataFifo_2048x12.v" has a depth of 2048 words of 12 bits each. The fifo is in show-ahead synchronous mode.  The data becomes available before 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read acknowledge. </P>
