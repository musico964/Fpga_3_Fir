<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "Fifo_16x24.v" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of scfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "Fifo_16x24.v".  The design "Fifo_16x24.v" has a depth of 16 words of 24 bits each. The fifo is in show-ahead synchronous mode.  The data becomes available before 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read acknowledge. </P>

<P><FONT size=3>The above waveform shows the behavior of the design for FIFO full condition. In the example above, data is written into the FIFO till it is full, then data is read back. </P>
